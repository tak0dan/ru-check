So essentially this is a little wrapper right
around your paru, that checks some data on a
contributor's github page and if something points
onto that ru swamp - It lets you know.

It can either be used for a security reasons, or
if you just don't want to raise installation
statistics on packages of some russian devs,
because fuck them.
