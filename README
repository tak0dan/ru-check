## Rationale

This project does **not** blacklist on nationality or ethnicity.
It implements a *jurisdiction- and sanctions-aware supply chain risk filter*
for AUR and makepkg.

The denylist includes:
- **Russian state-owned companies and domains** (e.g., Gazprom, Sberbank,
Rosatom) that directly finance and support Russia’s **illegal invasion and
aggression against Ukraine since 2014 (escalated in 2022)**.
- **Russian state propaganda outlets** (RT, Sputnik, RIA, TASS, Rossiyskaya
Gazeta) used to spread disinformation and legitimize war crimes.
- **Other sanctioned/authoritarian states** (Belarus, Iran, Syria, DPRK,
Venezuela, Palestine territories under Hamas) included for their role in
censorship, aggressive wars, or support of Russia’s aggression.

This tool is a *heuristic*. It warns users if packages are maintained or
sourced from high-risk jurisdictions.
Users can override, edit, or disable lists as they see fit by adding or
removing data in /usr/local/etc/.

Also, this list only sends warnings and those packages can still be installed.
Again, this is not a censorship tool, this is an information providing tool if
you feel suspicious about any of those organizations and want to avoid packages
from maintainers working on any of them.

I believe - it is quite important to be aknowledged about certain data about
maintainer of the package you are installing and be able to filter or control
your packages.
